Joint communication and control systems design

## 描述

Background: Modern distributed systems—ranging from industrial automation to environmental monitoring—require coordination among multiple autonomous agents. These agents must not only make local control decisions but also communicate effectively to maintain collective performance. Joint Communication and Control (JCC) is a co-design framework that tightly integrates control algorithms with communication strategies, enhancing system resilience and efficiency under limited resources. Main Task: This project involves designing, implementing, and evaluating a JCC framework for a simulated group of agents operating in a shared environment. The goal is to explore how communication constraints influence control decisions, and vice versa, in scenarios requiring coordinated behavior. Expected Outcomes: Demonstration of robust communication and control systems. Individual student direction. 1. Energy-Efficient Communication Strategies for Distributed Agents Investigate how to minimize communication energy consumption without compromising information reliability in distributed agent networks. 2. Time-Triggered vs. Event-Triggered Communication in Control Systems Analyze the effectiveness of time-based versus event-based communication schemes in control performance for autonomous agents. 3. Scalable Control Algorithms for Large Agent Populations Develop control algorithms specifically optimized for scalability in large multi-agent environments with minimal communication overhead. 4. Impact of Communication Delay on Distributed Control Stability Examine how various levels of communication delay affect control system stability and propose mitigation strategies. 5. Priority-Based Communication Scheduling in Multi-Agent Systems Design a scheduling mechanism where agents prioritize messages based on control-critical information. 6.
